## What is this?

This is a list of things you can do to improve your computer's security and your own privacy. Please feel free to ask questions about any of them!

### I don't know where to start!

That's common! There's a great tool to help you sort through that: the [Security Planner](https://securityplanner.consumerreports.org/). Feel free to start there and come back!

### Wow, this is long! What should I do first?

These are my top recommendations:

* Install a password manager on all your devices, and start adding your passwords to it.
* Laptops and desktops: Install [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) in your favorite web browser.
*  All web browsers, including mobile: [Change your default search engine away from Google](https://gizmodo.com/the-best-google-search-alternatives-if-privacy-is-your-1848613488). Also, [minimize Google's tracking](https://myaccount.google.com/security).
*   [Maximize your privacy on social media](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/social-media-how-to-use-it-safely).

## COMPREHENSIVE GUIDES

These are terrific mostly-comprehensive walk-throughs that will protect you from the commonest and most damaging privacy and security vulnerabilities.

*   EFF: [Security Self-Defense](https://ssd.eff.org/en)
*   [Lock Down Your Digital Identity](http://femtechnet.org/csov/lock-down-your-digital-identity/)
*   [Restore Privacy](https://restoreprivacy.com/) has a lot of useful tool suggestions and reviews, as well as pieces targeted to specific situations you might encounter.

## INTERNET OF THINGS

This one's easy: DON'T BUY THESE THINGS. No smart/talking toys. No Alexa, no Echo, no Siri. No smart appliances or lightbulbs or whatever.

Just don't. Their security is terrible and their privacy policies worse.

## ON EVERY DEVICE

### Using password managers

A password manager is what it sounds like: it creates and remembers hard-to-crack passwords so you don't have to! For many people, choosing bad passwords and reusing passwords are their easiest-to-exploit security vulnerabilities. Password managers can sync passwords among your devices, making long passwords much easier to use.

*   [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) (freemium, free version is capable, pro version quite inexpensive)
*   [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) (free/open source)

### Turning off geolocation

The more you allow your devices and social media to geolocate you, the more extensive, accurate, and hackable/leakable a picture of your habits exists. Stores, colleges/universities, and online trackers are collecting and keeping geolocation information to build such pictures. Also, if you believe yourself to be in danger from a stalker or domestic abuser, or even if you're just dealing with an ordinary nosy person, turning off geolocation is smart.

## LAPTOP OR DESKTOP COMPUTER

### Encrypting your hard drive

Encrypting your hard drive means that if your computer is stolen or lost, whoever ends up with it next cannot see your data.

*   Mac: [FileVault](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837)
*   Windows: [Windows 10 and 11](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/device-encryption-in-windows-ad5dcf4b-dbe0-2331-228f-7925c2a3012d), [Windows 8](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/10/windows-8-1-includes-seamless-automatic-disk-encryption-if-your-pc-supports-it/), [Windows 7](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd835565(v=ws.10).aspx)
*   Linux: try [TrueCrypt](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/33255/how-to-secure-your-linux-pc-by-encrypting-your-hard-drive/)

### Disabling sharing and unnecessary communications protocols

In general, if you're not using a particular communications protocol, turning it off is wise. Doing so reduces the number of ways your computer can be hacked.

*   Windows: [Windows 11](https://www.wired.com/story/11-security-settings-windows-11/), [Windows 10](http://download.cnet.com/blog/download-blog/a-guide-to-windows-10-security-settings/), [Windows 8](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/five-tips-managing-security-windows-8-1/)

### Setting up WiscVPN

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) keeps your online activity from being snooped on by random outsiders. This is **especially** important when you are using public wifi, as at a coffeeshop or airport. UW-Madison's WiscVPN is free for students, faculty, and staff to use.

### The Onion Router (TOR)

Tor disguises your Internet traffic and disassociates you from it by concealing your IP address. The Tor Browser is Firefox + Tor, and is desktop/laptop cross-platform. The Tails operating system is an OS-on-a-stick that you can take with you and use on computers you might not otherwise trust.

*   [Tails operating system](https://tails.boum.org/)

## BROWSER SETTINGS AND PLUGINS

### Browser (computer): Security-related settings

*   [Firefox](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2039455/five-steps-to-ultimate-firefox-security.html)
*   [Chrome](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/google-chrome-security-tips-for-the-paranoid-at-heart/)
*   [Microsoft Edge](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/get-to-know-the-security-features-in-edge/)

### Browser (computer and mobile): Changing default search engine away from Google

Google tracks you and your search history. DuckDuckGo does not. Use DuckDuckGo as your default search engine.

*   [Instructions for most browsers](https://duckduckgo.com/install)
*   Alternately, go to [DuckDuckGo's home page](https://duckduckgo.com/) and see if DDG prompts you to change your default search engine.

### Browser (computer): Security/privacy plugins

Web trackers and advertising networks are a major source of privacy leakage; ad networks increasingly contain malware. Every browser should install Privacy Badger and HTTPS Everywhere at minimum.

*   [Privacy Badger!](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger)
*   [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/#installation)
*   [More suggestions (cross-browser)](http://skytechgeek.com/2016/12/5-must-have-privacy-add-ons-for-your-browser/)
*   [Chrome Store plugins](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/privacy)

### Browser (mobile): Security/privacy plugins

*   [Safari on iOS](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2016/01/14/safari-privacy-iphone-ipad/)
*   [Firefox Focus for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/focus-by-firefox-content-blocking/id1055677337?mt=8) (browser and/or Safari ad/tracking blocker)
*   [Firefox (any platform)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/extensions/privacy-security/)
*   [Chrome (usually Android)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/privacy)

## MOBILE

It's  wise to go through your phone/tablet two or three times a year to **delete apps you don't use.** Every app you delete is one less app that can track you, and one less app that might offer attackers a way to hack your phone.

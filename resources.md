## What is this?

This is a list of things you can do to improve your devices' security and your own privacy. Please feel free to ask questions about any of them!

### I don't know where to start!

That's common! There's a great tool to help you sort through that: the [Security Planner](https://securityplanner.consumerreports.org/). Feel free to start there and come back!

### Wow, this is long! What should I do first?

These are my top recommendations:

* Go through your device(s) and remove any software/apps you don't use. That prevents them from leaking data, being breached, etc.
* For at least your most important online accounts, set up [multi-factor authentication](https://www.consumerreports.org/electronics/digital-security/best-way-to-use-two-factor-authentication-a1070812070/). If at all possible, use a physical security key or an app (such as [Authy](https://authy.com/) or [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2)) rather than text/SMS or email as your second factor. Still, text or email is better than nothing! (Eventually passkeys will take over from passwords-plus-multi-factor. Until then, though? Use multi-factor!)
* Install a password manager on all your devices, and start adding your passwords to it. [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) is an excellent choice.
* Laptops and desktops: Install [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) in your favorite web browser.
* All web browsers, including mobile: [Change your default search engine away from Google](https://gizmodo.com/the-best-google-search-alternatives-if-privacy-is-your-1848613488). Also, [minimize Google's tracking](https://myaccount.google.com/security).
*   [Maximize your privacy on social media](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/social-media-how-to-use-it-safely).

## COMPREHENSIVE GUIDES

These are terrific mostly-comprehensive walk-throughs that will protect you from the commonest and most damaging privacy and security vulnerabilities.

*   EFF: [Security Self-Defense](https://ssd.eff.org/en)
*   [Restore Privacy](https://restoreprivacy.com/) has a lot of [useful tool suggestions](https://restoreprivacy.com/privacy-tools/) and reviews, as well as pieces targeted to specific situations you might encounter.

## INTERNET OF THINGS

This one's easy: DON'T BUY THESE THINGS. No smart/talking toys. No Alexa, no Echo, no Siri. No smart appliances or lightbulbs or whatever.

Just don't. Their security is terrible and their privacy policies worse.

## ON EVERY DEVICE

### Using password managers

A password manager is what it sounds like: it creates and remembers hard-to-crack passwords so you don't have to! For many people, bad and/or reused passwords are their easiest-to-exploit security mistakes. Password managers can also sync passwords among your devices, making long passwords much easier to use.

*   [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) (freemium, free version is capable, pro version quite inexpensive)
*   [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) (free/open source)
*   [1Password](https://1password.com/) (subscription)

### Turning off geolocation

The more you allow your devices and social media to geolocate you, the more extensive, accurate, and hackable/leakable a picture of your habits exists. Stores, colleges/universities, and online trackers are collecting and keeping geolocation information to build such pictures. Also, if you believe yourself to be in danger from a stalker or domestic abuser, or even if you're just dealing with an ordinary nosy person, turning off geolocation is smart.

## LAPTOP OR DESKTOP COMPUTER

### Encrypting your hard drive

Encrypting your hard drive means that if your computer is stolen or lost, whoever ends up with it next cannot see your data.

*   Mac: [FileVault](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837)
*   Windows: [Windows 10 and 11](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/device-encryption-in-windows-ad5dcf4b-dbe0-2331-228f-7925c2a3012d)
*   Linux: try [TrueCrypt](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/33255/how-to-secure-your-linux-pc-by-encrypting-your-hard-drive/)

### Disabling sharing and unnecessary communications protocols

In general, if you're not using a particular communications protocol, turning it off is wise. Doing so reduces the number of ways your computer can be hacked.

*   Windows: [Windows 11](https://www.wired.com/story/11-security-settings-windows-11/), [Windows 10](http://download.cnet.com/blog/download-blog/a-guide-to-windows-10-security-settings/)

### Setting up WiscVPN

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) keeps your online activity from being snooped on by random outsiders. This is **especially** important when you are using public wifi, as at a coffeeshop or airport. UW-Madison's WiscVPN is free for students, faculty, and staff to use.

### The Onion Router (TOR)

Tor disguises your Internet traffic and disassociates you from it by concealing your IP address. The Tor Browser is Firefox + Tor, and is desktop/laptop cross-platform. The Tails operating system is an OS-on-a-stick that you can take with you and use on computers you might not otherwise trust.

## BROWSER SETTINGS AND PLUGINS

### Browser (computer): Security-related settings

*   [Firefox](https://restoreprivacy.com/firefox-privacy/)
*   I strongly discourage use of Chrome; Google, which has been documented lying about its privacy promises, is pulling a lot of privacy-damaging stunts with it. If your default browser is Google Chrome, I suggest getting rid of it and installing [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) instead. If you must, however: [Chrome](https://www.howtogeek.com/100361/how-to-optimize-google-chrome-for-maximum-privacy/)
*   [Microsoft Edge](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/get-to-know-the-security-features-in-edge/)

### Browser (computer and mobile): Changing default search engine away from Google

Google tracks you and your search history. DuckDuckGo does not. Use DuckDuckGo as your default search engine. [This piece](https://restoreprivacy.com/private-search-engine/) lists additional options. 

*   [Instructions for most browsers](https://duckduckgo.com/install)
*   Alternately, go to [DuckDuckGo's home page](https://duckduckgo.com/) and see if DDG prompts you to change your default search engine.

### Browser (computer): Security/privacy plugins

Web trackers and advertising networks are a major source of privacy leakage; ad networks increasingly contain malware. Every browser should install Privacy Badger at minimum.

*   [Privacy Badger!](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger)
*   [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/#installation)
*   [Chrome Store plugins](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/privacy)
*   [Firefox add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/extensions/category/privacy-security/)

### Browser (mobile): Security/privacy plugins

*   [Safari on iOS](https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-turn-on-locked-private-browsing-on-your-iphone)
*   [Firefox Focus for iOS](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/mobile/focus/) (browser and/or Safari ad/tracking blocker)
*   [Firefox (any platform)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/extensions/privacy-security/)
*   [Chrome (usually Android)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/privacy)

## MOBILE

It's  wise to go through your phone/tablet two or three times a year to **delete apps you don't use.** Every app you delete is one less app that can track you, and one less app that might offer attackers a way to hack your phone.

### Security settings and tools

*   iOS: [iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-privacy-security/)
*   [Basic security setup for Android](https://securityinabox.org/en/guide/basic-setup/android)
*   [Android](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/mobile-safety/7-android-security-hacks-you-need-to-do-right-now)
*   [Using mobile phones as securely as possible](hhttps://securityinabox.org/en/guide/smartphones/)

### iOS app privacy settings

*   [Apple's Privacy Nutrition Labels](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211970) Use these to decide which apps are collecting too much data for your peace.

In general, it is a bad idea to entrust sensitive data -- including health data -- to a mobile app. Vanishingly few can be trusted not to sell or share that data. If you have any of these apps, remove them, deleting data first if at all possible.

## SOCIAL MEDIA AND SEARCH ENGINES

### Privacy configuration and settings

In general, always turn off social media "personalization" features, which enable surveillance on and of your device.

*   [Google security settings](https://myaccount.google.com/security) (go through all of these and choose the most private option! turn off personalization!)
*   [Google privacy settings](https://myaccount.google.com/privacy)
